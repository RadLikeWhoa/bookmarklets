The sit in your favourites quietly without hogging any resources and they're quick to add and even quicker to use. They provide a wide variety of features on all kinds of sites. But some sites make it terribly hard to find their bookmarklets, others don't even officially provide one. That's why I created this site. This is a place to find bookmarklets for your favourite websites, be it social media sites like Twitter, Facebook or Tumblr, or sites like GitHub, Gist, and Zootool.</p><p>It's as simple as dragging and dropping a bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar. You can instantly recognize exactly which bookmarklet is which, as they're saved as "Network: Action". This is great for organising your bookmarklets and you'll be a pro in using them in no time.</p><p>It's really easy to add new entries. Just follow the <a href="https://github.com/RadLikeWhoa/bookmarklets#adding-new-bookmarklets">documentation</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/RadLikeWhoa/bookmarklets">GitHub repo</a>.</p></div></section><section id=instructions><div class="wrap outro"><h3 class=section-heading>Instructions</h3><dl class=instruction-list><dt>Desktop</dt><dd><ul><li>Drag-and-drop a bookmarklet to your favourites bar or to the folder you want to add it to.</li><li>Right-click a bookmarklet and choose "Add to favourites" (this may vary in different browsers).
